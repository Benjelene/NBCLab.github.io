# Abstract

Decision-making (DM) is an integral aspect of daily life and involves selecting an action from a set of available options or choices. Two often studied forms of uncertain DM are risky DM (choice outcome probabilities are generally known or easily inferred) and ambiguous DM (choice outcome probabilities are unknown or is same across available options). Common and distinct neurobiological correlates associated with risky and ambiguous DM domains, as well as specificity of such brain activity when compared to perceptual DM (acting as “control condition”), remains to be further clarified.
